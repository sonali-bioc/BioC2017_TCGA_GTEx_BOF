# BioC2017_TCGA_GTEx_BOF

This repository contains a brief outline for a 'Birds-of-Feather' (BOF) session to meet and discuss analyzing publicly available cancer data from TCGA &amp; GTEx

#  [TCGA](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) data 
1. 39 projects 
2. 29 primary sites 
3. 14551 cases 
4. 274,724 files
5. 22,144 genes 
6. 3,115,606 mutations

#  [GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) data 
1. 53 tissues 
2. 544 donors  
3. 8555 samples  


# Sources for getting TCGA data

1. [NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC) website](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) 
    + Nice interactive way of choosing samples, create a manifest file , and then download using gdc data transfer tool.
    + [NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud (CGC) pilots](https://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/nci-cancer-genomics-cloud-pilots/access-the-cloud-pilot-platforms)
    + [Broad Institute - FireCloud](https://software.broadinstitute.org/firecloud/)
    + [Institute for Systems Biology-CGC](http://cgc.systemsbiology.net/)
    + [Seven Bridges Genomics CGC](http://www.cancergenomicscloud.org/)
    + [NCI CGC Workshop/Tutorials by Team CGC](http://teamcgc.nci.nih.gov.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)
    + [NCI CGC Introduction PPT](https://www.slideshare.net/SteveTsang3/the-cancer-genomics-cloud-cgc-pilots-an-introduction)
2. [TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TCGAbiolinks.html)
3. [Recount2](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/) 
    + data is made available as a Bioconductor RangedSummarizedExperiment object.
    + data from select publications is also available
    + gene level and exon level data is present.
4. [RTCGAToolbox](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RTCGAToolbox.html)
5. [UCSC Xena Server](https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?host=https://tcga.xenahubs.net)  
    + contains data from other sources too such as  ICGC, TARGET, GTEx , TOIL   
    + RNASeq data is present as log2(RPKM+1),no raw read counts to use as input for edgeR or DESeq2  
    + mutation data, copy number data, protein expression RRPA, DNA methylation, miRNA isoform expression data.

6. ExperimentHub() contains raw RNASeq gene counts from TCGA. [GSE62944](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE62944)

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ExperimentHub)
eh = ExperimentHub()
query(eh, "TCGA")
tumor_samples = eh[["EH164"]]
normal_sample = eh[["EH165"]]
```
7. Re-normalize RNASeq data from TCGA using kallisto can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep39259)


# Sources for getting GTEx data 
1. GTEx website 
2. [Recount2](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)
3. **Coming Soon!!** will be added to ExperimentHub()

# What kind of analysis do you typically do with TCGA/GTEx data ? Packages being used ? 

1. clustering of samples/ genes - PCA plots. 
2. differenrial expression analysis between 2 chosen groups?0 using RNASeq data
3. mutation analysis 

# Other publicly available databases for Cancer / Cool resources for studying cancer
